### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Camber, I am a Junior Sotware Developer based in Houston, TX

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on growing my career and development by pursuing a Masters of Computer Science through University of Colorado Boulder
  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: <br>
  Email: camberlyn@outlook.com <br>
  Linkedin: www.linkedin.com/in/camber-edge
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love cooking, music, and learning new things!
- My github may be a little empty, as I work full-time and study as a master's student full-time as well.  Many school projects are stored/submitted elsewhere and are unable to be released publicly in order to prevent copying/cheating - but rest assured I am working on software studies, leetcode, and projects everyday :)
